## Database Credentials

PostgreSQL credentials depend on the machine ID. When working with PostgreSQL, especially in remote environments, always retrieve the current machine ID first to ensure the correct credentials are used.

### Machine ID: 2b04e5cc1d014b0897d12efeb29adb31

On this specific machine, the PostgreSQL server is configured to use **peer authentication** for local connections to the `postgres` database for the `postgres` system user.

This means that when connecting as the `postgres` operating system user to the `postgres` database on `localhost`, a database password is not required.

The command that successfully logs in using this method is:
`sudo -u postgres psql -d postgres`

If connecting from a different system user or using a different database, other authentication methods (like password authentication) may be required, and the appropriate credentials would be needed.

### Machine: aaa@aaa-Virtual-Machine (Machine ID Unknown)

For the machine identified as `aaa@aaa-Virtual-Machine`, the PostgreSQL credentials are:
- **Username:** `postgres`
- **Password:** `temp_password`

Note: The specific authentication method configured on this machine is not currently documented. You may need to use password authentication when connecting with these credentials.
